## Description
Memory
Create a game based on the card game Memory.

You'll need to generate a grid of cards. Each card should have a picture on it, and there should be 2 of each picture. So, if you have a deck of 10 cards there should be 5 different pictures.

All cards should start face down. Each time the user takes a turn they click on 2 cards. When a card is clicked it should reveal its picture. If the user gets a pair of cards with the same picture, the the cards remain face-up. If the user's selected cards are different they should return to face down. When all the cards are face up, the user has won. The object of the game is to find all the pairs in as few turns as possible.
